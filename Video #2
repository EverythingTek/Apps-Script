//Hello all
//Today we are going to be learning how to custom format a sheet from apps script

function onOpen()
{
  //This function gets triggered when the sheet gets opened
  //In this function we are going to create a new menu
  //In that menu we are going to have a bunch of options
  //This is just a template
  //We highly reccomend you experiment with what is shown and use it to your needs
  let ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  ui.createMenu("Features")
  .addItem("Hide Row", "hideRow") //the second string calls the hide row function (which we will make later)
  .addItem("Hide Column", "hideColumn") 
  .addItem("Share with Editors", "addEditor")
  .addItem("Share with Viewers", "addViewer")
  .addToUi();
}

function hideRow()
{
  //The purpose of this function is to hide a row
  //NOTE: When you first use the menu you will get a message from google
  //You have to sign in and give apps script some permissions

  let sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  //This gets the sheet
  let cell = sheet.getActiveCell();
  //This gets the active cell
  sheet.hideRows(cell.getRow());
  //This hides the row
}

//Okay now lets make another function
function hideColumn()
{
  //In this function we will hide the column of the user
  //lets copy paste the code from above

    let sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  //This gets the sheet
  let cell = sheet.getActiveCell();
  //This gets the active cell
  sheet.hideColumns(cell.getColumn());
  //This hides the column
}
//Sometimes apps script is slow so reloading never hurts (Unless you forgot to save your apps script file)

function addEditor()
{
  //If you share you document with the same people
  //This is the perfect function for you
  let spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  spreadsheet.addEditor("something@something.com") //Insert the email address of the person you would like to share it with here

}

function addViewer()
{
  let spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  spreadsheet.addViewer("something@something.com") //Insert the email address of the person you would like to share 
}


//Thank you for watching
//In the next video I will continue showing other types of functions to format sheets
//Please like and sub if you enjoyed
//Also we have a github account where all of our codes will be posted
//Link the in description below
